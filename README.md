## Purpose ##

This program was made to experiment with networking.

## Features and improvements: ##

* Currently no GUI to open server.
* Uses TCP to communicate between server and client.
* Can have multiple clients in a single chatroom.
* Can change username.
* Can view users online.
* No private messaging yet, could add by making the server only send message only to intended recipient.
* Should probably used 2-3 letter string before main body of message to identify message type.
* Messages not encrpted.
* Packet size could be reduced.
